# omnifocus-to-kanban

## What is this?

This is a tool that synchronises data from[OmniFocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) with a [LeanKit](https://leankit.com) or [Trello](https://trello.com) board.

## Why?

This allows you to visualise your Omnifocus data on a Kanban board or task board. I prefer this to manage my work in progress than using Omnifocus alone. Here's a [blog I wrote](http://rhydlewis.net/blog/2015/9/29/how-i-use-personal-kanban-to-stay-in-control-of-my-work-and-get-stuff-done-part-2) with more info on my thinking.
